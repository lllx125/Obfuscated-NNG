By ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ, a = 0 ∨ Θ7Κr d = 0. The first contradicts ha, the second contradicts ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec. Thus this case is impossible, closing by contradiction.\n   - If c = Θ7Κr e, use the successor recursion ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr to rewrite both sides of h to addition: ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a e) a, then cancel the common right addend a via γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU to get ΕWβ a d = ΕWβ a e.

{"draft": "We need to show that if ΕWβ a b = a and a ≠ GnΑ0, then b = gfΧ. The key observations are: (1) gfΧ acts as the right identity for ΕWβ, i.e., ΤyΥewev says ΕWβ a gfΧ = a; and (2) we have a left-cancellation property for ΕWβ when the left factor is nonzero: ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ states that if a ≠ GnΑ0 and ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c, then b = c. Using these, we rewrite the goal to the form required by left cancellation. Specifically, from h: ΕWβ a b = a and ΤyΥewev a: ΕWβ a gfΧ = a, we obtain ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a gfΧ. Then apply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ with c = gfΧ and ha to conclude b = gfΧ. The rewriting is accomplished by successively rewriting the goal using h and ΤyΥewev a, reducing it to a = a, which is solved by rfl.", "code": "intro a b ha h\napply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ a b gfΧ ha\nrw [h]\nrw [ΤyΥewev a]\nexact rfl"}
