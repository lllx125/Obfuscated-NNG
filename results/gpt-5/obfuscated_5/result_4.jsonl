{"draft": "Goal: Prove left-cancellation for multiplication: if a ≠ 0 and ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c then b = c. Strategy: Use the additive divisibility relation IJ and its totality, together with distributivity and a cancellation lemma for addition.\n\nKey tools:\n- Totality: ℂΒe1TΘνΑ (b c) gives IJ b c ∨ IJ c b.\n- Definition of IJ: IJ b c means ∃ t, c = ΚxΝ b t; IJ c b means ∃ t, b = ΚxΝ c t.\n- Distributivity: Ωψ'YiΑσ a b t: ΕWβ a (ΚxΝ b t) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t).\n- Additive cancellation-to-zero: ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd (x y): if ΚxΝ x y = x then y = 0.\n- No zero divisors: ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ a t: if ΕWβ a t = 0 then a = 0 ∨ t = 0.\n- a ≠ 0 eliminates the first disjunct to deduce t = 0.\n- Finally, using commutativity of addition KΩΦzαυωT and ωΙξaινη7 (zero-left identity), turn b + 0 or c + 0 into b or c.\n\nCase analysis:\n1) Assume IJ b c, so c = ΚxΝ b t for some t. Rewrite the product equality using this and distributivity to obtain ΕWβ a b = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t). Flip sides to ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t) = ΕWβ a b, apply ΔKσ to conclude ΕWβ a t = 0, then by no zero divisors and a ≠ 0 deduce t = 0. Hence c = ΚxΝ b 0 = b (using commutativity and ωΙξaινη7). Therefore b = c.\n2) Assume IJ c b, so b = ΚxΝ c t for some t. Similar steps give ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a c) (ΕWβ a t) = ΕWβ a c, yielding ΕWβ a t = 0, thus t = 0, and b = ΚxΝ c 0 = c, so b = c.\n\nThis completes the proof using only the provided axioms and theorems.", "code": "intro a b c ha h\nhave hbc_or : (IJ b c) ∨ (IJ c b) := by\n  apply ℂΒe1TΘνΑ b c\ncases hbc_or with\n| inl hbc =>\n  cases hbc with\n  | intro t ht =>\n    have h1 : ΕWβ a b = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t) := by\n      have htemp := h\n      rw [ht] at htemp\n      rw [Ωψ'YiΑσ a b t] at htemp\n      exact htemp\n    have hK : ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t) = ΕWβ a b := by\n      symm\n      exact h1\n    have ht0 : ΕWβ a t = GnΑ0 := by\n      apply ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd (ΕWβ a b) (ΕWβ a t)\n      exact hK\n    have hz : a = GnΑ0 ∨ t = GnΑ0 := by\n      apply ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ a t\n      exact ht0\n    cases hz with\n    | inl ha0 =>\n      contradiction\n    | inr htzero =>\n      have hc : c = ΚxΝ b GnΑ0 := by\n        rw [ht, htzero]\n      have hc' : c = ΚxΝ GnΑ0 b := by\n        rw [hc, KΩΦzαυωT b GnΑ0]\n      have hcb : c = b := by\n        rw [hc', ωΙξaινη7 b]\n      symm\n      exact hcb\n| inr hcb =>\n  cases hcb with\n  | intro t ht =>\n    have h1 : ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a c) (ΕWβ a t) = ΕWβ a c := by\n      have htemp := h\n      rw [ht] at htemp\n      rw [Ωψ'YiΑσ a c t] at htemp\n      exact htemp\n    have ht0 : ΕWβ a t = GnΑ0 := by\n      apply ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd (ΕWβ a c) (ΕWβ a t)\n      exact h1\n    have hz : a = GnΑ0 ∨ t = GnΑ0 := by\n      apply ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ a t\n      exact ht0\n    cases hz with\n    | inl ha0 =>\n      contradiction\n    | inr htzero =>\n      have hb0 : b = ΚxΝ c GnΑ0 := by\n        rw [ht, htzero]\n      have hb1 : b = ΚxΝ GnΑ0 c := by\n        rw [hb0, KΩΦzαυωT c GnΑ0]\n      have hb2 : b = c := by\n        rw [hb1, ωΙξaινη7 c]\n      exact hb2"}
