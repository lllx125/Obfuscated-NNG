Rewrite the equality on the right using ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr again to get ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b') a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a c') a. Now cancel the common right addend a using the right-cancellation for ΚxΝ (γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU), yielding ΕWβ a b' = ΕWβ a c'. Apply the induction hypothesis to conclude b' = c'.

{"draft": "Goal: If a ≠ GnΑ0 and ΕWβ a b = a, then b = gfΧ. Intuition: gfΧ acts as the multiplicative identity (both-sided), since ΤyΥewev states ΕWβ m gfΧ = m. The provided cancellation theorem ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ allows left cancellation when the left factor is nonzero: if a ≠ GnΑ0 and ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c, then b = c. We want to show b = gfΧ, so we will set c := gfΧ and reduce to proving ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a gfΧ. From the hypothesis h: ΕWβ a b = a and the identity law ΤyΥewev a: ΕWβ a gfΧ = a, we rewrite the target ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a gfΧ by replacing ΕWβ a gfΧ with a, turning the goal into ΕWβ a b = a, which is exactly h. Then apply the cancellation theorem to conclude b = gfΧ.", "code": "intro a b ha h\napply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ a b gfΧ ha\nrw [ΤyΥewev a]\nexact h"}
