By ηΡdnPHf9_ℂE_zXGΚ, this implies a = GnΑ0, contradicting ha. So this case is impossible.\n  b) If c = Θ7Κr m: Rewrite both sides of h via ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr to obtain ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a m) a. Now use the additive right-cancellation lemma γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU to deduce ΕWβ a d = ΕWβ a m. Apply the inductive hypothesis on d and m to get d = m. Finally, conclude Θ7Κr d = Θ7Κr m, hence b = c.\n\nThis uses only the given axioms and theorems: the zero-product property for multiplication, the distributivity expression ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr, and the additive cancellation γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU.

{"draft": "Goal: From ΕWβ a b = a and a ≠ GnΑ0, deduce b = gfΧ.\nKey idea: Use the right-cancellation-like lemma ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ, which states that if a ≠ GnΑ0 and ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c, then b = c. We will set c = gfΧ. Since ΤyΥewev a gives ΕWβ a gfΧ = a, the given equality h: ΕWβ a b = a can be rewritten to ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a gfΧ. Then apply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ with ha to obtain b = gfΧ.\nProof steps:\n1) Apply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ with c = gfΧ. This reduces the goal to showing ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a gfΧ.\n2) Rewrite the right-hand side using ΤyΥewev a (i.e., ΕWβ a gfΧ = a) to transform the goal into ΕWβ a b = a, which is exactly the given hypothesis h.\n3) Close the goal with exact h.", "code": "apply ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ a b gfΧ ha\nrw [ΤyΥewev a]\nexact h"}
