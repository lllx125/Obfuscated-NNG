The structure `Η0Ja` is defined inductively with two constructors: `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr`.\n2. The function `gfΧ` is defined as `Θ7Κr GnΑ0`.\n3. From theorem `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`, we know that `Θ7Κr n = ΚxΝ n gfΧ` for any `n : Η0Ja`.\n4. The theorem `o5Εgγtdvl` states that if `Θ7Κr a = Θ7Κr b`, then `a = b`.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. **Use Induction:** Since `Η0Ja` is an inductive type, we can proceed by induction on `x`.\n2. **Base Case (`x = GnΑ0`):**\n   - Show that if `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 gfΧ = ΚxΝ y gfΧ`, then `GnΑ0 = y`.\n   - Use theorem `ωΙξaινη7` to simplify `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 gfΧ` to `gfΧ`.\n   - So we have `gfΧ = ΚxΝ y gfΧ`.\n   - From `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`, `ΚxΝ y gfΧ = Θ7Κr y`.\n   - Thus, `gfΧ = Θ7Κr y`.\n   - But `gfΧ = Θ7Κr GnΑ0`, so `Θ7Κr GnΑ0 = Θ7Κr y`.\n   - Apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to conclude `GnΑ0 = y`.\n3. **Inductive Step (`x = Θ7Κr d`):**\n   - Assume the theorem holds for `d` (inductive hypothesis).\n   - Show that if `ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr d) gfΧ = ΚxΝ y gfΧ`, then `Θ7Κr d = y`.\n   - Use theorem `gXqΧΔℝvO` to rewrite `ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr d) gfΧ` as `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ d gfΧ)`.\n   - So we have `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ d gfΧ) = ΚxΝ y gfΧ`.\n   - From `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`, `ΚxΝ y gfΧ = Θ7Κr y`.\n   - Thus, `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ d gfΧ) = Θ7Κr y`.\n   - Apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to get `ΚxΝ d gfΧ = y`.\n   - Now, from the inductive hypothesis, if we can show `ΚxΝ d gfΧ = ΚxΝ y' gfΧ` implies `d = y'`, we can conclude.\n   - But we already have `y = ΚxΝ d gfΧ`, so we need to express `y` in terms of `gfΧ`.\n   - However, this seems circular.

This is exactly what we need for the contrapositive.\n\n3. **Structure the Proof:**\n   - Assume `Θ7Κr m = Θ7Κr n`.\n   - Apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to conclude `m = n`.\n   - This proves the contrapositive, hence the original statement.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- The theorem `o5Εgγtdvl` is already proven and directly applicable here.\n- No additional lemmas or induction is needed because the injectivity of `Θ7Κr` is already established.\n\n**Lean Code Outline:**\n- Use `contrapose!` to switch to the contrapositive statement.\n- Apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to the equality `Θ7Κr m = Θ7Κr n`.\n- The rest follows directly.\n\n### Final Lean Code\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\n1. `contrapose! h` transforms the goal from `Θ7Κr m ≠ Θ7Κr n` to `Θ7Κr m = Θ7Κr n → m = n` (the contrapositive of the original statement).\n2. `exact o5Εgγtdvl m n h` applies the injectivity lemma `o5Εgγtdvl` to the hypothesis `h : Θ7Κr m = Θ7Κr n`, yielding `m = n`, which closes the proof.\n\nThis proof is concise and leverages the existing injectivity lemma directly.", "code": "theorem βΖLMclΥhℂuΘ (m n : Η0Ja) (h : m ≠ n) : Θ7Κr m ≠ Θ7Κr n := by\n  contrapose! h\n  exact o5Εgγtdvl m n h"}

Expand `gfΧ` using its definition (`Θ7Κr GnΑ0`).\n2. Use the multiplication axiom for the `Θ7Κr` case (`ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`), since `gfΧ` is of the form `Θ7Κr GnΑ0`.\n3. Simplify `ΕWβ m GnΑ0` using the base case axiom (`θ'vxθΑfφ`), which gives `GnΑ0`.\n4. Now we have `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 m`. From theorem `ωΙξaινη7`, we know `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 n = n` for any `n`. Apply this to simplify `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 m` to `m`.\n5. The result will directly match the right-hand side of the goal (`m`).\n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. Rewrite `gfΧ` as `Θ7Κr GnΑ0`.\n2.

Next, we simplify `ΕWβ m GnΑ0` to `GnΑ0` using the base case axiom for multiplication.\n4. Finally, we apply the theorem `ωΙξaινη7` to simplify `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 m` to `m`, which completes the proof.\n\nThis proof relies on the existing axioms and theorems about the operations `ΚxΝ` and `ΕWβ`, and it systematically simplifies the expression step by step.", "code": "theorem ΤyΥewev (m : Η0Ja) : ΕWβ m gfΧ = m := by\n  rw [U3ωΘτ_q_7oH_ℂe9no] -- gfΧ = Θ7Κr GnΑ0\n  rw [ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr] -- ΕWβ m (Θ7Κr GnΑ0) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ m GnΑ0) m\n  rw [θ'vxθΑfφ] -- ΕWβ m GnΑ0 = GnΑ0\n  rw [ωΙξaινη7] -- ΚxΝ GnΑ0 m = m"}

Rewrite both sides using the axiom `θ'vxθΑfφ` which states `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0`.\n2. Left side becomes `ΕWβ (ΚxΝ a b) GnΑ0 = GnΑ0`.\n3.

The proof will proceed by induction on `n`, since the power operation `νΦΗ` is defined recursively in its second argument.\n\n**Base Case (n = GnΑ0)**:\n1.

The theorem states that if either `x` is `Wre0` or `y` is `χΗΡd`, then either `y` is `χΗΡd` or `x` is `Wre0`. \n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The statement is purely about logical disjunction (`∨`) and equality.\n2. The definitions of `Wre0` and `χΗΡd` aren't actually needed for the proof - this is just about the symmetry of disjunction.\n3. In Lean, we can prove this by case analysis on the hypothesis `h : x = Wre0 ∨ y = χΗΡd`.\n\n**Proof Steps:**\n1. Start with the hypothesis `h : x = Wre0 ∨ y = χΗΡd`.\n2. Do case analysis on `h`:\n   - Case 1: Assume `x = Wre0`. We need to show `y = χΗΡd ∨ x = Wre0`. This follows immediately by `right, exact ‹x = Wre0›`.\n   - Case 2: Assume `y = χΗΡd`. We need to show `y = χΗΡd ∨ x = Wre0`. This follows immediately by `left, exact ‹y = χΗΡd›`.\n3. In both cases, we can use the `left` and `right` tactics to construct the disjunction we need.\n\n**Lean Code:**\n```lean\ntheorem ΙIℂpEmρ (x y : Η0Ja) (h : x = Wre0 ∨ y = χΗΡd) : y = χΗΡd ∨ x = Wre0 := by\n  cases h with\n  | inl hx => right; exact hx\n  | inr hy => left; exact hy\n```\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nAlternatively, we could recognize that this is just the commutativity of disjunction and use the `tauto` tactic which handles propositional logic:\n\n\n\nHowever, since we're asked to provide a detailed proof plan, the case analysis approach is more explicit and demonstrates understanding of the logical structure.

Now, by `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`, `Θ7Κr a = ΚxΝ a gfΧ`.\n8. Substitute: `ΚxΝ c (Θ7Κr a) = ΚxΝ c (ΚxΝ a gfΧ)`.\n9. By associativity (`nv3ΧWtℕsL`), `ΚxΝ c (ΚxΝ a gfΧ) = ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ c a) gfΧ`.\n10. By commutativity again, `ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ c a) gfΧ = ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ a c) gfΧ`.\n11. Now, recall `b = ΚxΝ a c`, so this becomes `ΚxΝ b gfΧ`.\n12. But `Θ7Κr b = ΚxΝ b gfΧ` by `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`.\n13. Thus, we have `Θ7Κr b = ΚxΝ a (ΚxΝ c gfΧ)` (from steps 4-11).\n14. Therefore, `d = ΚxΝ c gfΧ` is the witness we need for `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFrom `IJ a b`, we derived `Θ7Κr b = ΚxΝ a (ΚxΝ c gfΧ)`, proving `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)`.\n\n### Lean 4 Code\n\n\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n1. `intro h`: Assume `IJ a b`.\n2. `rw [_iΝf'_εfApyη9tGD] at *`: Rewrite the definition of `IJ` in both the goal and hypothesis.\n3. `cases h with | intro c hc`: Extract the witness `c` such that `b = ΚxΝ a c`.\n4. `use ΚxΝ c gfΧ`: Provide `ΚxΝ c gfΧ` as the witness for the goal.\n5.

So, `IJ a b` means that `b` is a \"multiple\" of `a` in this system.\n\n**Goal**: Given `h : IJ a b` (i.e., `b = ΚxΝ a c` for some `c`), we need to show `IJ (ΕWβ a t) (ΕWβ b t)` (i.e., `ΕWβ b t = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a t) d` for some `d`).\n\n**Approach**:\n1.

Instead of proving `ΕWβ a b ≠ GnΑ0 → b ≠ GnΑ0`, we will prove the equivalent statement `b = GnΑ0 → ΕWβ a b = GnΑ0`.\n2. From the axiom `θ'vxθΑfφ`, we know that `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0` for any `a`.\n3.

The operation `ΕWβ` resembles multiplication in this alien system.\n2. The theorem resembles the cancellation property for multiplication: if `a * b = a * c` and `a ≠ 0`, then `b = c`.\n3. We have several theorems about `ΕWβ` and `ΚxΝ` (which resembles addition) that might help in proving this cancellation property.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. **Case Analysis on `b`:**\n   - Since `Η0Ja` is inductively defined with constructors `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr`, we can perform case analysis on `b`.\n   - If `b = GnΑ0`, we need to show `c = GnΑ0` using the given equality `ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c`.\n   - If `b = Θ7Κr n` for some `n`, we need to show `c = Θ7Κr m` for some `m` and then prove `n = m`.\n\n2. **Using Existing Theorems:**\n   - `θ'vxθΑfφ`: `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0`.\n   - `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`: `ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr b) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) a`.\n   - `γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU`: If `ΚxΝ a n = ΚxΝ b n`, then `a = b`.\n   - `TeL1SWχπRβcζνl`: If `ΚxΝ n a = ΚxΝ n b`, then `a = b`.\n\n3. **Handling the `b = GnΑ0` Case:**\n   - If `b = GnΑ0`, then `ΕWβ a b = GnΑ0` by `θ'vxθΑfφ`.\n   - Thus, `ΕWβ a c = GnΑ0`.\n   - By `ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ`, this implies `a = GnΑ0` or `c = GnΑ0`.\n   - But `a ≠ GnΑ0` by hypothesis, so `c = GnΑ0 = b`.\n\n4. **Handling the `b = Θ7Κr n` Case:**\n   - Similarly, `c` must be `Θ7Κr m` for some `m` (since `a ≠ GnΑ0` and `ΕWβ a c = ΕWβ a b ≠ GnΑ0` by `eΦ6τΔΥZξℕmΥ`).\n   - Expand `ΕWβ a b` and `ΕWβ a c` using `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`:\n     - `ΕWβ a b = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a n) a`.\n     - `ΕWβ a c = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a m) a`.\n   - The equality becomes `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a n) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a m) a`.\n   - Apply `TeL1SWχπRβcζνl` to cancel `a` (since `a ≠ GnΑ0`):\n     - `ΕWβ a n = ΕWβ a m`.\n   - By induction hypothesis (if needed), `n = m`, so `b = c`.\n\n**Lean 4 Code:**\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n1.

{"draft": "### Proof Plan Draft\n\n**Goal:** Prove that if `ΕWβ a b = a` and `a ≠ GnΑ0`, then `b = gfΧ`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. From `a ≠ GnΑ0`, we know `a` must be of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n` (by `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`).\n2. The theorem `ΤyΥewev` tells us that `ΕWβ m gfΧ = m` for any `m`. This suggests `gfΧ` is a right identity for `ΕWβ`.\n3. We need to show that `b` must be exactly `gfΧ` when `ΕWβ a b = a`.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. Use `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ` to express `a` as `Θ7Κr n` since `a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n2. Rewrite the hypothesis `ΕWβ a b = a` using the expression for `a`.\n3. Use the multiplication axiom `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr` to expand `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) b`.\n4. This will give us `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n b) (Θ7Κr n) = Θ7Κr n`.\n5. Use theorem `_adiΜ2ieMΩeaΖΒΞK` to deduce that `ΕWβ n b = GnΑ0`.\n6. Now consider two cases for `n`:\n   - If `n = GnΑ0`, then `a = gfΧ` (since `gfΧ = Θ7Κr GnΑ0`).\n   - If `n ≠ GnΑ0`, use `ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ` to conclude `b = GnΑ0` from `ΕWβ n b = GnΑ0`.\n7. However, if `b = GnΑ0`, then `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0` by `θ'vxθΑfφ`, which contradicts `ΕWβ a b = a` unless `a = GnΑ0`, which is false by hypothesis.\n8. Therefore, the only possibility is `n = GnΑ0`, making `a = gfΧ`.\n9. Then `ΕWβ gfΧ b = gfΧ`, and by `ΤyΥewev`, `ΕWβ gfΧ gfΧ = gfΧ`.\n10. Use `ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ` to conclude `b = gfΧ`.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nAlternatively, after step 5, we can use the fact that `ΕWβ n b = GnΑ0` implies `n = GnΑ0` or `b = GnΑ0` (by `ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ`). Since `a ≠ GnΑ0`, `n` must be `GnΑ0`, leading to `a = gfΧ`.
