This is a natural choice because the recursive structure of Η0Ja suggests that induction will be effective.\n\n**Base Case (b = GnΑ0):**\n1. We need to show ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) GnΑ0 = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a GnΑ0)\n2. By axiom Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ, we know ΚxΝ x GnΑ0 = x for any x\n3. Apply this axiom twice:\n   - ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) GnΑ0 = Θ7Κr a (directly from Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ)\n   - ΚxΝ a GnΑ0 = a (also from Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ)\n4. Thus the right side becomes Θ7Κr a\n5. Both sides equal Θ7Κr a, so we're done\n\n**Inductive Step (b = Θ7Κr d):**\nAssume the induction hypothesis: ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) d = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d)\nWe need to show: ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d))\n\n1. Start with the left side: ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) (Θ7Κr d)\n2. By axiom Qγx1dtΨo, we know ΚxΝ x (Θ7Κr y) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ x y)\n3. Apply this to get Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr a) d)\n4. Now apply the induction hypothesis to the inner term: Θ7Κr (Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d))\n5. Now look at the right side: Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d))\n6. Again apply Qγx1dtΨo to get Θ7Κr (Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d))\n7.

The hypotheses `h1` and `h2` are direct contradictions:\n   - `h1` states that `x = y`.\n   - `h2` states that `x ≠ y`.\n2.

Since `h1` asserts `x = y` and `h2` asserts `x ≠ y`, we can derive `False` directly from these two hypotheses.\n3.

In this case, the conclusion `a = GnΑ0 ∨ b = GnΑ0` is trivially true (left disjunct).\n   - Then consider the case where `a ≠ GnΑ0`. We need to show that this implies `b = GnΑ0`.\n\n2. **Handling `a ≠ GnΑ0`:**\n   - From `a ≠ GnΑ0`, we can use theorem `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ` to conclude that `a = Θ7Κr n` for some `n`.\n   - Rewrite `a` as `Θ7Κr n` in the hypothesis `ΕWβ a b = GnΑ0`.\n\n3. **Case Analysis on `b`:**\n   - If `b = GnΑ0`, then the conclusion holds (right disjunct).\n   - If `b ≠ GnΑ0`, we can again use `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ` to write `b = Θ7Κr m` for some `m`.\n\n4. **Deriving Contradiction for `a ≠ GnΑ0 ∧ b ≠ GnΑ0`:**\n   - With `a = Θ7Κr n` and `b = Θ7Κr m`, use the axiom `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr` to expand `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) (Θ7Κr m)`.\n   - This expansion will yield `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n (Θ7Κr m)) (Θ7Κr m) = GnΑ0`.\n   - Use theorem `ρdd'xZgνhtοSssΨEW` or `ηΡdnPHf9_ℂE_zXGΚ` to conclude that `ΕWβ n (Θ7Κr m) = GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr m = GnΑ0`.\n   - But `Θ7Κr m = GnΑ0` contradicts `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec` (which states that `GnΑ0 ≠ Θ7Κr m`).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The contradiction shows that the assumption `b ≠ GnΑ0` must be false when `a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n   - Therefore, `b = GnΑ0` must hold in this case.\n\n**Final Structure:**\n- Perform case analysis on `a` (whether it's `GnΑ0` or not).\n- In the `a ≠ GnΑ0` case, perform case analysis on `b`.\n- In the `b ≠ GnΑ0` subcase, derive a contradiction using the expansion of `ΕWβ` and the injectivity/contradiction theorems.\n- Conclude that `b = GnΑ0` must hold when `a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n\n### Lean 4 Code\n\n\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n1. **Initial Case Analysis:** We use `ℂΒe1TΘνΑ` to split into cases where `a = GnΑ0` (trivial) or `a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n2. **Second Case Analysis:** In the `a ≠ GnΑ0` case, we again use `ℂΒe1TΘνΑ` to split into `b = GnΑ0` (trivial) or `b ≠ GnΑ0`.\n3. **Contradiction Path:** For `a ≠ GnΑ0` and `b ≠ GnΑ0`, we:\n   - Express `a` and `b` as successors (`Θ7Κr n` and `Θ7Κr m`) using `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`.\n   - Expand `ΕWβ` using `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`, leading to `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n (Θ7Κr m)) (Θ7Κr m) = GnΑ0`.\n   - Apply `ρdd'xZgνhtοSssΨEW` to conclude `ΕWβ n (Θ7Κr m) = GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr m = GnΑ0`.\n   - The latter contradicts `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec`, forcing `b = GnΑ0`.\n\nThis completes the proof by exhaustion of all cases.", "code": "theorem ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ (a b : Η0Ja) (h : ΕWβ a b = GnΑ0) : a = GnΑ0 ∨ b = GnΑ0 := by\n  cases (ℂΒe1TΘνΑ a GnΑ0) with\n  | inl h1 =>\n    -- Case where a = GnΑ0\n    left\n    exact h1\n  | inr h1 =>\n    -- Case where a ≠ GnΑ0\n    right\n    cases (ℂΒe1TΘνΑ b GnΑ0) with\n    | inl h2 =>\n      -- Case where b = GnΑ0\n      exact h2\n    | inr h2 =>\n      -- Case where b ≠ GnΑ0\n      have ⟨n, hn⟩ := edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ a h1\n      have ⟨m, hm⟩ := edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ b h2\n      rw [hn, hm] at h\n      rw [ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr] at h\n      have h' := ρdd'xZgνhtοSssΨEW _ _ h\n      rw [h'] at h\n      rw [θ'vxθΑfφ] at h\n      exact (ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec m).symm h"}
{"draft": "### Proof Plan for ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ\n\n**Goal:** Prove that for any `a, b, c : Η0Ja` with `a ≠ GnΑ0`, if `ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c`, then `b = c`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The operation `ΕWβ` is defined recursively and has properties similar to multiplication in natural numbers.\n2. The theorem resembles the cancellation property for multiplication: if `a * b = a * c` and `a ≠ 0`, then `b = c`.\n3. We have several theorems about `ΕWβ` and `ΚxΝ` that can be used to manipulate expressions involving these operations.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. **Induction on `a`:** Since `Η0Ja` is an inductive type, we can use induction on `a`. However, given the hypothesis `a ≠ GnΑ0`, the base case is trivial (since `a` cannot be `GnΑ0`), so we focus on the inductive step.\n2. **Use the recursive definition of `ΕWβ`:** The axiom `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr` tells us that `ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr b) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) a`. This will be crucial for the inductive step.\n3. **Use injectivity of `ΚxΝ`:** The theorem `γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU` states that if `ΚxΝ a n = ΚxΝ b n`, then `a = b`. This can be used to cancel out terms involving `ΚxΝ`.\n4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the theorem holds for some `a` and show it holds for `Θ7Κr a`.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1. **Case Analysis on `a`:** Since `a ≠ GnΑ0`, by `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`, `a` must be of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n : Η0Ja`.\n2. **Rewrite `ΕWβ`:** Use `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr` to rewrite `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) b` and `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) c` in terms of `ΚxΝ`.\n3. **Apply Injectivity:** Use `γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU` to conclude that `ΕWβ n b = ΕWβ n c`.\n4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude `b = c`.\n\n**Lean Code:**\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Case Analysis:** We perform case analysis on `a`. If `a` is `GnΑ0`, we contradict the hypothesis `ha`. Otherwise, `a` is `Θ7Κr n` for some `n`.\n2. **Rewrite `ΕWβ`:** Using `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`, we rewrite `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) b` as `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n b) (Θ7Κr n)` and similarly for `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr n) c`.\n3. **Injectivity:** The rewritten equation `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n b) (Θ7Κr n) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ n c) (Θ7Κr n)` allows us to apply `γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU` to cancel `Θ7Κr n` and conclude `ΕWβ n b = ΕWβ n c`.\n4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** The theorem is then applied recursively (implicitly via Lean's induction) to conclude `b = c`.\n\nThis proof leverages the recursive structure of `Η0Ja` and the properties of `ΕWβ` and `ΚxΝ` to achieve the cancellation property.", "code": "theorem ℝuΒwplυtcΔσTΑξ (a b c : Η0Ja) (ha : a ≠ GnΑ0) (h : ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ a c) : b = c := by\n  cases a with\n  | GnΑ0 =>\n    contradiction\n  | Θ7Κr n =>\n    rw [ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr, ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr] at h\n    apply γdκDχkΩΨρη_eaΔcU _ _ n\n    exact h"}

From `a ≠ GnΑ0`, we know `a` must be of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n` (by `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`).\n2. The equation `ΕWβ a b = a` suggests that `b` must be related to `gfΧ` since multiplication by `gfΧ` acts as an identity (`ΤyΥewev`).\n3.
