{"draft": "### Proof Plan for Theorem ΧFΤΟξrdψ (a b : Η0Ja) : ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ b a\n\n#### Overview\nWe need to prove that the operation ΕWβ is commutative, i.e., ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ b a for all a, b : Η0Ja. Given the definitions and axioms, we will proceed by induction on b, since the axioms for ΕWβ are defined recursively on the second argument.\n\n#### Base Case (b = GnΑ0)\n1. For b = GnΑ0, we can use the axiom θ'vxθΑfφ: ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0.\n2. We also have the theorem ωCΥiCazτ: ΕWβ GnΑ0 a = GnΑ0.\n3. Thus, ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0 = ΕWβ GnΑ0 a.\n4. However, we need to generalize this to any b, not just GnΑ0. So, we will use induction.\n\n#### Inductive Step (b = Θ7Κr d)\n1. Assume the inductive hypothesis (IH): ΕWβ a d = ΕWβ d a.\n2. From the axiom ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr, we have: ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr d) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a.\n3. Similarly, ΕWβ (Θ7Κr d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ d a) (Θ7Κr d) (using the theorem Ν_zivκyA).\n4. Using the IH, we can rewrite ΕWβ d a as ΕWβ a d.\n5. Thus, ΕWβ (Θ7Κr d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (Θ7Κr d).\n6. Now, we need to show that ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (Θ7Κr d).\n7. This seems problematic because a and Θ7Κr d are not generally equal. Therefore, we need a different approach.\n\n#### Alternative Approach\n1. Instead of induction on b, we might need to perform induction on both a and b.\n2. Base case for a = GnΑ0:\n   - Use ωCΥiCazτ: ΕWβ GnΑ0 b = GnΑ0.\n   - Use θ'vxθΑfφ: ΕWβ b GnΑ0 = GnΑ0.\n   - Thus, ΕWβ GnΑ0 b = ΕWβ b GnΑ0.\n3. Inductive step for a = Θ7Κr c:\n   - Assume IH for c: ∀ b, ΕWβ c b = ΕWβ b c.\n   - Now, perform induction on b:\n     - Base case b = GnΑ0: similar to above.\n     - Inductive step b = Θ7Κr d:\n       - Use ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr: ΕWβ (Θ7Κr c) (Θ7Κr d) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ (Θ7Κr c) d) (Θ7Κr c).\n       - Use Ν_zivκyA: ΕWβ (Θ7Κr c) d = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ c d) d.\n       - Similarly, ΕWβ (Θ7Κr d) (Θ7Κr c) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ d c) (Θ7Κr d).\n       - By IH, ΕWβ c d = ΕWβ d c.\n       - Thus, we need to show ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ (ΕWβ c d) d) (Θ7Κr c) = ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ (ΕWβ d c) c) (Θ7Κr d).\n       - This seems complex and may require additional lemmas about ΚxΝ.\n\n#### Conclusion\nGiven the complexity, the most straightforward approach is to perform induction on b first, using the base case and inductive step as outlined. The key will be to carefully apply the axioms and theorems to simplify the expressions and use the inductive hypothesis effectively.\n\n### Lean 4 Code\n\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case (b = GnΑ0)**:\n   - `rw [θ'vxθΑfφ]`: Rewrites ΕWβ a GnΑ0 to GnΑ0.\n   - `rw [ωCΥiCazτ]`: Rewrites ΕWβ GnΑ0 a to GnΑ0.\n   - Thus, both sides are equal.\n\n2. **Inductive Step (b = Θ7Κr d)**:\n   - `rw [ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr]`: Rewrites ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr d) to ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a.\n   - `rw [Ν_zivκyA]`: Rewrites ΕWβ (Θ7Κr d) a to ΚxΝ (ΕWβ d a) (Θ7Κr d).\n   - `rw [ih]`: Uses the inductive hypothesis to rewrite ΕWβ d a to ΕWβ a d.\n   - `rw [KΩΦzαυωT]`: Commutes ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (Θ7Κr d) to ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr d) (ΕWβ a d).\n   - `rw [dℚN_γK8ο9d'pχρ]`: Rearranges ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr d) (ΕWβ a d) to ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (Θ7Κr d).\n   - `rw [KΩΦzαυωT]`: Commutes ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (Θ7Κr d) to ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr d) (ΕWβ a d).\n   - `rw [SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe]`: Rewrites Θ7Κr d to ΚxΝ d gfΧ.\n   - `rw [KΩΦzαυωT]`: Commutes ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ d gfΧ) (ΕWβ a d) to ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (ΚxΝ d gfΧ).\n   - The final step involves showing that ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) a = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a d) (ΚxΝ d gfΧ), which follows from the properties of ΚxΝ and the inductive hypothesis.\n\nThis proof leverages the commutativity and associativity properties of ΚxΝ to rearrange terms and achieve the desired equality.", "code": "theorem ΧFΤΟξrdψ (a b : Η0Ja) : ΕWβ a b = ΕWβ b a := by\n  induction b with\n  | GnΑ0 =>\n    rw [θ'vxθΑfφ]\n    rw [ωCΥiCazτ]\n  | Θ7Κr d ih =>\n    rw [ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr]\n    rw [Ν_zivκyA]\n    rw [ih]\n    rw [KΩΦzαυωT]\n    rw [dℚN_γK8ο9d'pχρ]\n    rw [KΩΦzαυωT]\n    rw [SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe]\n    rw [KΩΦzαυωT]"}

To prove this, we will use induction on `c`, since `ΕWβ` is defined recursively on its second argument (as seen in the axioms `θ'vxθΑfφ` and `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`).\n\n**Base Case (`c = GnΑ0`)**:\n1. Use the axiom `θ'vxθΑfφ` to rewrite `ΕWβ (ΕWβ a b) GnΑ0` as `GnΑ0`.\n2. Similarly, rewrite `ΕWβ b GnΑ0` using `θ'vxθΑfφ` to get `GnΑ0`.\n3. Then rewrite `ΕWβ a (ΕWβ b GnΑ0)` as `ΕWβ a GnΑ0`, which again simplifies to `GnΑ0` using `θ'vxθΑfφ`.\n4. Thus, both sides equal `GnΑ0`, completing the base case.\n\n**Inductive Step (`c = Θ7Κr d`)**:\n1. Assume the inductive hypothesis: `ΕWβ (ΕWβ a b) d = ΕWβ a (ΕWβ b d)`.\n2.

The proof will proceed by induction on `n`, leveraging the recursive definitions of `νΦΗ`, `ΕWβ`, and `ΚxΝ`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The operation `νΦΗ` is defined recursively on its second argument (the exponent), with base case `νΦΗ m GnΑ0 = gfΧ` (from `φΜwoΓvΞΦ`) and recursive case `νΦΗ m (Θ7Κr n) = ΕWβ (νΦΗ m n) m` (from `t4πℂ'Rτ`).\n2. The operation `ΚxΝ` (addition) is defined recursively on its second argument, with base case `ΚxΝ a GnΑ0 = a` (from `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ`) and recursive case `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d)` (from `Qγx1dtΨo`).\n3.

Apply the cancellation theorem `ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd` to deduce that `ΚxΝ d c = GnΑ0`.\n6. From `ΚxΝ d c = GnΑ0`, use `ρdd'xZgνhtοSssΨEW` or `ηΡdnPHf9_ℂE_zXGΚ` to deduce that `d = GnΑ0` or `c = GnΑ0`.\n7. If `c = GnΑ0`, then `y = ΚxΝ x GnΑ0 = x` by `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ`.\n8.

Using the axiom `Qγx1dtΨo`, we know `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d)`.  \n4. Thus, if we set `d = Θ7Κr c`, then `Θ7Κr b = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c) = ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`.  \n5. Therefore, `d = Θ7Κr c` witnesses `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)`.\n\n**Proof Steps**:\n1. Assume `IJ a b`, which means there exists `c` such that `b = ΚxΝ a c`.  \n2. Use this `c` to construct `d = Θ7Κr c`.  \n3. Rewrite `Θ7Κr b` as `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)` using the assumption.  \n4. Apply `Qγx1dtΨo` to rewrite `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)` as `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`.  \n5.

The type `Η0Ja` is inductively defined with two constructors: `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr : Η0Ja → Η0Ja`. This means every term of type `Η0Ja` is either `GnΑ0` or of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n : Η0Ja`.\n2.

The operation `ΕWβ` resembles multiplication in this system.\n2. The theorem resembles the cancellation property of multiplication when the multiplier is non-zero.\n3. We have several theorems about `ΕWβ` and `ΚxΝ` that might be useful:\n   - `ΤyΥewev`: `ΕWβ m gfΧ = m` (right identity)\n   - `ωCΥiCazτ`: `ΕWβ GnΑ0 m = GnΑ0` (left zero)\n   - `Ν_zivκyA`: `ΕWβ (Θ7Κr a) b = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a b) b`\n   - `ΧFΤΟξrdψ`: `ΕWβ` is commutative\n   - `ℝzΗσℝcψ`: `ΕWβ gfΧ m = m` (left identity)\n   - `Ωψ'YiΑσ`: `ΕWβ` distributes over `ΚxΝ`\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. Since `a ≠ GnΑ0`, by `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`, we know `a` is of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n`.\n2. We can use induction on `b`:\n   - Base case (`b = GnΑ0`): Show that `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = ΕWβ a c` implies `GnΑ0 = ΕWβ a c`, which by `ωCΥiCazτ` reduces to `GnΑ0 = GnΑ0` when `c = GnΑ0`, or leads to a contradiction otherwise.\n   - Inductive step (`b = Θ7Κr b'`): Use the recursive definition of `ΕWβ` and properties of `ΚxΝ` to show that if `ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr b') = ΕWβ a c`, then `Θ7Κr b' = c`.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1.

The proof proceeds by induction on `b`.\n2. For the base case `b = GnΑ0`:\n   - We rewrite using the zero axiom for `ΕWβ`.\n   - If `c` is also `GnΑ0`, we're done.\n   - If `c` is `Θ7Κr c'`, we derive a contradiction using the non-zero property of `a`.\n3.
