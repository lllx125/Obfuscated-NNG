Rewrite the hypothesis `ΚxΝ x gfΧ = Wre0` using `XfξHc_eqζΗJcιrVEr9` to express `Wre0` as `Θ7Κr χΗΡd`.\n2. Use `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe` to rewrite `Θ7Κr χΗΡd` as `ΚxΝ χΗΡd gfΧ`.\n3. Now the hypothesis is `ΚxΝ x gfΧ = ΚxΝ χΗΡd gfΧ`.\n4. Use commutativity of `ΚxΝ` (`KΩΦzαυωT`) to rewrite both sides as `ΚxΝ gfΧ x = ΚxΝ gfΧ χΗΡd`.\n5. We need to show that `ΚxΝ gfΧ` is injective, i.e., `ΚxΝ gfΧ a = ΚxΝ gfΧ b → a = b`.\n   - This can be done by induction on `a` and `b`, but since we don't have an explicit injectivity lemma, we can instead use the structure of `ΚxΝ`.\n   - Alternatively, we can use the fact that `Θ7Κr` is injective (`o5Εgγtdvl`) and `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr b) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a b)` (`Qγx1dtΨo`).\n6. From `ΚxΝ gfΧ x = ΚxΝ gfΧ χΗΡd`, we can rewrite using `Qγx1dtΨo` to get `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ gfΧ y) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ gfΧ z)` for some `y, z`, and then apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to conclude `ΚxΝ gfΧ y = ΚxΝ gfΧ z`.\n   - This is not directly applicable, so we need a better approach.\n7. Instead, note that `gfΧ = Θ7Κr GnΑ0`, so `ΚxΝ gfΧ x = ΚxΝ (Θ7Κr GnΑ0) x = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ GnΑ0 x)` by `Qγx1dtΨo`.\n   - Similarly, `ΚxΝ gfΧ χΗΡd = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ GnΑ0 χΗΡd)`.\n   - Thus, the hypothesis becomes `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ GnΑ0 x) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ GnΑ0 χΗΡd)`.\n   - Apply `o5Εgγtdvl` to get `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 x = ΚxΝ GnΑ0 χΗΡd`.\n   - By `ωΙξaινη7`, `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 x = x` and `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 χΗΡd = χΗΡd`.\n   - Thus, `x = χΗΡd`.\n\n**Final Proof Outline:**\n1. Rewrite `Wre0` in the hypothesis.\n2. Rewrite `Θ7Κr χΗΡd` using `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`.\n3. Use commutativity of `ΚxΝ` to rearrange terms.\n4. Expand `gfΧ` as `Θ7Κr GnΑ0` and apply `Qγx1dtΨo`.\n5.

This is a trivial implication in logic, often referred to as the \"identity implication\". The proof should be straightforward since we're proving that a statement implies itself.\n\n**Proof Strategy**:\n1.

The goal will then be to prove `x = Wre0`, which is exactly our hypothesis. Thus, we can finish the proof by using the `exact` tactic with the hypothesis.\n\n**Lean Code**:\n\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `intro h`: This tactic introduces the premise `x = Wre0` as a hypothesis named `h`.\n- `exact h`: Since the goal is `x = Wre0` and we have `h : x = Wre0`, we can directly use `h` to satisfy the goal.\n\nThis proof is intentionally simple because the theorem itself is a basic logical tautology.

{"draft": "### Proof Plan Draft\n\n**Theorem Statement:** `Θ7Κr a ≠ GnΑ0`\n\n**Goal:** Prove that the constructor `Θ7Κr` applied to any `a : Η0Ja` does not equal `GnΑ0`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The type `Η0Ja` has two constructors: `GnΑ0` (the \"zero\" element) and `Θ7Κr` (the \"successor\" constructor).\n2. The constructors are disjoint by definition - this is a fundamental property of inductive types in Lean.\n3. We have a similar theorem already proven: `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec (a : Η0Ja) : GnΑ0 ≠ Θ7Κr a` which states essentially the same thing but with the inequality reversed.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. The inequality `Θ7Κr a ≠ GnΑ0` is the symmetric version of `GnΑ0 ≠ Θ7Κr a`.\n2. Inequality is symmetric, so we can use the existing theorem `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec` and just apply symmetry.\n3. Alternatively, we could reproduce the proof structure of `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec` but with the inequality reversed.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1. Option 1 (Simple Symmetry):\n   - Use the existing theorem `ΙΩζβτeΜwυ'ec` which proves `GnΑ0 ≠ Θ7Κr a`.\n   - Apply symmetry to get `Θ7Κr a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n\n2. Option 2 (Direct Proof):\n   - Assume the opposite: `Θ7Κr a = GnΑ0`.\n   - Use the predicate `ℂy'tΒγ` which distinguishes between `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr` cases:\n     - `ℂy'tΒγ GnΑ0 = True`\n     - `ℂy'tΒγ (Θ7Κr _) = False`\n   - Rewrite using the assumption to get a contradiction between `True` and `False`.\n\n**Selected Approach:**\nWe'll use Option 1 since it's more concise and leverages existing work.

Substitute `x` from `hyx` into `hxy` to express `y` in terms of `y`, `c`, and `d`.\n3. Use properties of `ΚxΝ` (commutativity, associativity, etc.) to simplify and derive `x = y`.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1. From `hxy`, obtain `c` such that `y = ΚxΝ x c`.\n2. From `hyx`, obtain `d` such that `x = ΚxΝ y d`.\n3. Substitute `x` into `y = ΚxΝ x c`:\n   - `y = ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ y d) c`.\n4. Use associativity (`nv3ΧWtℕsL`) and commutativity (`KΩΦzαυωT`) to rewrite:\n   - `y = ΚxΝ y (ΚxΝ d c)`.\n5. Now, we have `y = ΚxΝ y (ΚxΝ d c)`. This resembles the form `ΚxΝ x y = x`, which by `ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd` implies `y = GnΑ0`.\n   - However, here `y` is on both sides, so we need to rearrange.\n6. Rewrite using commutativity: `ΚxΝ y (ΚxΝ d c) = y` is equivalent to `ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ d c) y = y`.\n7. Now apply `_adiΜ2ieMΩeaΖΒΞK` to conclude `ΚxΝ d c = GnΑ0`.\n8. From `ΚxΝ d c = GnΑ0`, use `ρdd'xZgνhtοSssΨEW` or `ηΡdnPHf9_ℂE_zXGΚ` to conclude that `d = GnΑ0` or `c = GnΑ0`.\n9. If `d = GnΑ0`, substitute back into `x = ΚxΝ y d`:\n   - `x = ΚxΝ y GnΑ0 = y` (by `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ`).\n10. Similarly, if `c = GnΑ0`, substitute into `y = ΚxΝ x c`:\n    - `y = ΚxΝ x GnΑ0 = x`.\n11. In either case, we get `x = y`.\n\n**Lean 4 Code:**\n\n\n\n### Explanation of the Lean Code:\n1. We start by extracting the witnesses `c` and `d` from `hxy` and `hyx` using `cases`.\n2. Rewrite `y` using `hc` and `x` using `hd`.\n3. Use commutativity (`KΩΦzαυωT`) and associativity (`nv3ΧWtℕsL`) to rearrange the expression.\n4. The goal becomes `y = ΚxΝ y (ΚxΝ d c)`, which we rewrite using commutativity to `ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ d c) y = y`.\n5. Apply `_adiΜ2ieMΩeaΖΒΞK` to conclude `ΚxΝ d c = GnΑ0`.\n6. The final step uses `rfl` because `ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ d c) y = y` simplifies to `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 y = y`, which is exactly `y = y` by `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ` (though Lean's `rfl` handles this automatically).\n\nThis completes the proof that `x = y` under the given conditions.", "code": "theorem F3ΥπΔωψPuXEι (x y : Η0Ja) (hxy : IJ x y) (hyx : IJ y x) : x = y := by\n  cases hxy with | intro c hc =>\n  cases hyx with | intro d hd =>\n  rw [hc, hd]\n  rw [KΩΦzαυωT, nv3ΧWtℕsL, KΩΦzαυωT]\n  rw [← KΩΦzαυωT d c]\n  apply _adiΜ2ieMΩeaΖΒΞK\n  rw [KΩΦzαυωT]\n  exact rfl"}

Using the axiom `Qγx1dtΨo`, we know `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)`.\n5. Thus, `Θ7Κr b = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c) = ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`.\n6.

Use `use Θ7Κr c` to provide the witness for `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)`.\n5. Rewrite `Θ7Κr b` as `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)` using `hc`.\n6. Apply `Qγx1dtΨo` to rewrite `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)` as `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`.\n7.

The operation `ΕWβ` represents multiplication in this system, and we have several theorems about its properties.\n2. The theorem resembles a cancellation law for multiplication when the multiplier is non-zero.\n3. We have theorems about injectivity of `ΚxΝ` (which seems to represent addition) and properties of `ΕWβ`.\n\n**Main Strategy:**\n1. Use induction on `b` to handle both base case (`b = GnΑ0`) and inductive step (`b = Θ7Κr b'`).\n2. For the base case (`b = GnΑ0`):\n   - Show that `ΕWβ a GnΑ0 = GnΑ0` using axiom `θ'vxθΑfφ`.\n   - Then `ΕWβ a c = GnΑ0`, and use theorem `ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ` to conclude that `c` must be `GnΑ0` (since `a ≠ GnΑ0`).\n3.

The proof proceeds by induction on `b`.\n2. In the base case (`b = GnΑ0`), we show `c` must also be `GnΑ0`.\n3. In the inductive step, we first show that `ΕWβ a c` cannot be zero (using `h_ne`).\n4. This forces `c` to be of form `Θ7Κr c'` (using `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`).\n5. We then rewrite both sides using the multiplication axiom `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`.\n6.

From `ha : a ≠ GnΑ0`, we know `a` must be of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n` (by `edΦΝuseUf_nρΥcυzχθ`).\n2. The equation `ΕWβ a b = a` suggests that `b` must be related to `gfΧ` (which is `Θ7Κr GnΑ0`), since `ΕWβ m gfΧ = m` (by `ΤyΥewev`).\n3. We need to show that `b` cannot be any other value besides `gfΧ` that would satisfy `ΕWβ a b = a`.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\n1. **Case Analysis on `b`:**\n   - Since `b` can be either `GnΑ0` or `Θ7Κr n` for some `n`, we'll consider these cases.\n   - If `b = GnΑ0`, then `ΕWβ a b = GnΑ0` (by `θ'vxθΑfφ`), which contradicts `ΕWβ a b = a` and `a ≠ GnΑ0`.\n   - Thus, `b` must be of the form `Θ7Κr n` for some `n`.\n2. **Unfold `ΕWβ` Definition:**\n   - For `b = Θ7Κr n`, we have `ΕWβ a (Θ7Κr n) = ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a n) a` (by `ΑΩ7Ξ3νnr`).\n   - The equation becomes `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a n) a = a`.\n3. **Use Theorem `ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd`:**\n   - From `ΚxΝ (ΕWβ a n) a = a`, we deduce `ΕWβ a n = GnΑ0` (by `ΔKσ_ivζgΜtοδsIdd`).\n4. **Analyze `ΕWβ a n = GnΑ0`:**\n   - Since `a ≠ GnΑ0`, by `ℝRΞΧJRℂYψeℕ`, we must have `n = GnΑ0`.\n   - Thus, `b = Θ7Κr GnΑ0 = gfΧ`.\n\n**Lean Code:**\n\n\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Case Analysis:** We first consider whether `b` is `GnΑ0` or `Θ7Κr n`.
