{"draft": "### Proof Plan for ωΙξaινη7\n\n**Theorem Statement:** `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 n = n`\n\n**Interpretation:** This theorem states that when we perform the operation `ΚxΝ` with `GnΑ0` as the first argument and any element `n` of `Η0Ja` as the second argument, the result is `n` itself. This suggests that `GnΑ0` acts as a left identity element for the operation `ΚxΝ`.\n\n**Proof Strategy:**\nWe will proceed by induction on `n`, since `Η0Ja` is an inductive type with two constructors:\n1. `GnΑ0` (the base case)\n2. `Θ7Κr d` (the recursive case)\n\n**Base Case (`n = GnΑ0`):**\n- We need to show `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 GnΑ0 = GnΑ0`\n- This follows directly from axiom `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ` which states `ΚxΝ a GnΑ0 = a` for any `a`. Here we take `a = GnΑ0`.\n\n**Inductive Case (`n = Θ7Κr d`):**\n- Inductive hypothesis: Assume `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 d = d` (for some `d : Η0Ja`)\n- We need to show `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr d`\n- Using axiom `Qγx1dtΨo`: `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d)`\n  - Here take `a = GnΑ0`\n- So we get `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ GnΑ0 d)`\n- Now apply the inductive hypothesis to rewrite `ΚxΝ GnΑ0 d` as `d`\n- Final result: `Θ7Κr d` which is exactly what we need\n\n**Lean Code Implementation:**\nThe proof will use the `induction` tactic with two cases:\n1. For `GnΑ0`, we'll use `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ`\n2. For `Θ7Κr d`, we'll use `Qγx1dtΨo` and the inductive hypothesis\n\n### Formal Proof in Lean 4\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. The `induction` tactic creates two cases based on the constructors of `Η0Ja`.\n2. In the `GnΑ0` case, we simply apply the axiom `Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ` which directly proves the equality.\n3. In the `Θ7Κr d` case:\n   - First rewrite using `Qγx1dtΨo` to expand `ΚxΝ` over `Θ7Κr`\n   - Then use the inductive hypothesis `ih` to simplify the inner expression\n   - The result simplifies to exactly `Θ7Κr d` as required\n\nThis completes the proof by induction, showing that `GnΑ0` is indeed a left identity for the `ΚxΝ` operation.", "code": "theorem ωΙξaινη7 (n : Η0Ja) : ΚxΝ GnΑ0 n = n := by\n  induction n with\n  | GnΑ0 =>\n    rw [Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ]\n  | Θ7Κr d ih =>\n    rw [Qγx1dtΨo, ih]"}

The structure of `Η0Ja` is inductive with two constructors: `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr d`. Thus, the induction will have two cases:\n1. Base case: `n = GnΑ0`\n2. Inductive step: `n = Θ7Κr d`, assuming the theorem holds for `d` (induction hypothesis)\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Base Case (`n = GnΑ0`):**\n   - Use the axiom `φΜwoΓvΞΦ` which states `νΦΗ m GnΑ0 = gfΧ` for any `m`.\n   - The left-hand side (LHS) becomes `νΦΗ (ΕWβ a b) GnΑ0 = gfΧ` by `φΜwoΓvΞΦ`.\n   - The right-hand side (RHS) becomes `ΕWβ (νΦΗ a GnΑ0) (νΦΗ b GnΑ0) = ΕWβ gfΧ gfΧ` by `φΜwoΓvΞΦ`.\n   - We need to show `gfΧ = ΕWβ gfΧ gfΧ`. \n   - Use the theorem `ℝzΗσℝcψ` which states `ΕWβ gfΧ m = m` for any `m`.

The hypothesis `h` is a disjunction (`∨`), so we can case split on it.\n2. In each case of the disjunction, one of the disjuncts will be true, and we can directly construct the conclusion.\n3.

This means `IJ x y` holds if `y` can be expressed as `ΚxΝ x c` for some `c`. From the theorems provided, we know that `ΚxΝ` is commutative (`KΩΦzαυωT`) and associative (`nv3ΧWtℕsL`).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. The structure of `Η0Ja` is inductive with two constructors: `GnΑ0` and `Θ7Κr`.\n2. We have theorems showing how `ΚxΝ` behaves with these constructors (`Ε6ΖΜF_Zζ`, `Qγx1dtΨo`).\n3.

The inductive nature of `Η0Ja` suggests that induction is the right approach.\n\n**Base Cases:**\n1. When `x = GnΑ0`:  \n   - From theorem `aτPWZ1β`, we know `IJ GnΑ0 y` holds for any `y`. So the disjunction holds trivially.\n2. When `y = GnΑ0`:  \n   - Similarly, `IJ x GnΑ0` may or may not hold, but if it doesn't, we can use the base case for `y = GnΑ0` to show `IJ GnΑ0 x`.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\n1. Assume `x = Θ7Κr x'` and `y = Θ7Κr y'`.  \n   - We need to show either `IJ (Θ7Κr x') (Θ7Κr y')` or `IJ (Θ7Κr y') (Θ7Κr x')`.\n   - From `SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe`, we know `Θ7Κr x' = ΚxΝ x' gfΧ`.  \n   - Thus, `Θ7Κr y' = ΚxΝ y' gfΧ`.  \n   - We can rewrite `IJ (Θ7Κr x') (Θ7Κr y')` as `∃ c, ΚxΝ y' gfΧ = ΚxΝ (ΚxΝ x' gfΧ) c`.  \n   - Using associativity and commutativity of `ΚxΝ`, this can be simplified.  \n   - By the induction hypothesis on `x'` and `y'`, we know either `IJ x' y'` or `IJ y' x'`.  \n   - This will allow us to construct the required `c` in either case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe proof will proceed by induction on `x` and `y`, handling the base cases directly and using the inductive hypothesis to construct the necessary witness `c` in the inductive step.\n\n### Lean 4 Code for Theorem ℂΒe1TΘνΑ\n\n\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Base Case for `x = GnΑ0`:**  \n   - We use `left` to choose `IJ GnΑ0 y`, which is proven by `aτPWZ1β y`.\n\n2. **Inductive Case for `x = Θ7Κr x'`:**  \n   - We perform nested induction on `y`.\n   - **Base Case for `y = GnΑ0`:**  \n     - We use `right` to choose `IJ y x`, which is `IJ GnΑ0 (Θ7Κr x')`, proven by `aτPWZ1β (Θ7Κr x')`.\n   - **Inductive Case for `y = Θ7Κr y'`:**  \n     - We case split on the inductive hypothesis `ihy : IJ x' y' ∨ IJ y' x'`.\n     - If `IJ x' y'` holds (`inl h1`), we construct a witness for `IJ (Θ7Κr x') (Θ7Κr y')` using `gfΧ` and the properties of `ΚxΝ`.\n     - If `IJ y' x'` holds (`inr h2`), we similarly construct a witness for `IJ (Θ7Κr y') (Θ7Κr x')`.\n\nThe proof leverages the commutativity and associativity of `ΚxΝ` to rearrange terms and construct the necessary witnesses.", "code": "theorem ℂΒe1TΘνΑ (x y : Η0Ja) : (IJ x y) ∨ (IJ y x) := by\n  induction x with\n  | GnΑ0 =>\n    left\n    exact aτPWZ1β y\n  | Θ7Κr x' ihx =>\n    induction y with\n    | GnΑ0 =>\n      right\n      exact aτPWZ1β (Θ7Κr x')\n    | Θ7Κr y' ihy =>\n      cases ihy with\n      | inl h1 =>\n        left\n        rw [SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe, SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe]\n        cases h1 with\n        | intro c hc =>\n          use ΚxΝ gfΧ c\n          rw [hc, nv3ΧWtℕsL, KΩΦzαυωT, KΩΦzαυωT x']\n      | inr h2 =>\n        right\n        rw [SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe, SZuΟvETq_ιWνJe]\n        cases h2 with\n        | intro c hc =>\n          use ΚxΝ gfΧ c\n          rw [hc, nv3ΧWtℕsL, KΩΦzαυωT, KΩΦzαυωT y']"}

From `IJ a b`, we have `b = ΚxΝ a c` for some `c`.  \n2. We need to express `Θ7Κr b` in terms of `ΚxΝ a d` for some `d`.  \n3. Using the axiom `Qγx1dtΨo`, we know that `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr d) = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a d)`.  \n4. Thus, if we set `d = Θ7Κr c`, then:  \n   `Θ7Κr b = Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c) = ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)` (by `Qγx1dtΨo`).  \n5. Therefore, `Θ7Κr b = ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`, which means `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)` holds with `d = Θ7Κr c`.\n\n**Proof Steps:**  \n1. Assume `IJ a b`, which means there exists `c` such that `b = ΚxΝ a c`.  \n2. Use `Qγx1dtΨo` to rewrite `Θ7Κr (ΚxΝ a c)` as `ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`.  \n3. Thus, `Θ7Κr b = ΚxΝ a (Θ7Κr c)`, so `IJ a (Θ7Κr b)` holds with witness `Θ7Κr c`.  \n4.
