{"draft": "### Proof Plan for `succ_add`\n\nWe aim to prove the theorem `succ_add (a b : MyNat) : succ a + b = succ (a + b)` by induction on `b`, using only the provided axioms for addition (`add_zero` and `add_succ`).\n\n1. **Base Case (`b = zero`):**\n   - By `add_zero (succ a)`, rewrite `succ a + zero` to `succ a`.\n   - By `add_zero a`, rewrite `a + zero` to `a`, so `succ (a + zero)` becomes `succ a`.\n   - Thus, both sides equal `succ a`, completing the base case.\n\n2. **Inductive Step (`b = succ d`):**\n   - Assume the induction hypothesis (IH): `succ a + d = succ (a + d)`.\n   - Left-hand side: `succ a + succ d`\n     - Apply `add_succ (succ a) d` to rewrite as `succ (succ a + d)`.\n     - Use IH to rewrite `succ a + d` as `succ (a + d)`, yielding `succ (succ (a + d))`.\n   - Right-hand side: `succ (a + succ d)`\n     - Apply `add_succ a d` to rewrite `a + succ d` as `succ (a + d)`, so the entire expression becomes `succ (succ (a + d))`.\n   - Both sides are now identical, completing the inductive step.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   By induction on `b`, the theorem holds for all `a, b : MyNat`.\n\n### Lean 4 Code", "code": "theorem succ_add (a b : MyNat) : succ a + b = succ (a + b) := by\n  induction b with\n  | zero =>\n      rw [add_zero]\n  | succ d ih =>\n      rw [add_succ (succ a) d, ih, add_succ a d]"}
