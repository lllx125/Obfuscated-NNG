{"draft": "### Proof Plan for `succ_add`\n\nWe aim to prove the theorem `succ_add (a b : MyNat) : succ a + b = succ (a + b)` by induction on `b`. The proof follows the standard structure of induction on natural numbers in Peano arithmetic, using the provided axioms for addition.\n\n1. **Base Case (`b = zero`)**:\n   - Rewrite `succ a + zero` to `succ a` using `add_zero`.\n   - Rewrite `a + zero` to `a` using `add_zero`.\n   - The goal becomes `succ a = succ a`, which holds trivially.\n\n2. **Inductive Step (`b = succ d`)**:\n   - Assume the induction hypothesis (IH): `succ a + d = succ (a + d)`.\n   - Rewrite `succ a + (succ d)` to `succ (succ a + d)` using `add_succ`.\n   - Rewrite `a + (succ d)` to `succ (a + d)` using `add_succ` on the right-hand side.\n   - The goal becomes `succ (succ a + d) = succ (succ (a + d))`.\n   - Apply the induction hypothesis to rewrite `succ a + d` as `succ (a + d)`.\n   - The goal simplifies to `succ (succ (a + d)) = succ (succ (a + d))`, which is true by reflexivity.\n\nThe proof relies solely on the axioms `add_zero` and `add_succ`, and the induction principle for `MyNat`. The `trivial` tactic is used to close the trivial equality goals after rewriting.\n\n### Lean 4 Code", "code": "theorem succ_add (a b : MyNat) : succ a + b = succ (a + b) := by\n  induction b with\n  | zero =>\n      rw [add_zero, add_zero]\n      trivial\n  | succ d ih =>\n      rw [add_succ, add_succ, ih]\n      trivial"}
