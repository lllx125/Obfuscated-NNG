Since a is not equal to Gn\u03910, we can use the property of \u0395W\u03b2 to show that if b were not equal to gf\u03a7, it would lead to a contradiction. We will also utilize the axiom \u211dR\u039e\u03a7JR\u2102Y\u03c8e\u2115 to explore the implications of our assumptions. By carefully manipulating the equations and applying the axioms, we will arrive at the conclusion that b must indeed be equal to gf\u03a7.", "code": "have h1 : b \u2260 Gn\u03910 := by\n  intro hb\n  have h2 : \u0395W\u03b2 a b = Gn\u03910 := by rw [hb, \u03b8'vx\u03b8\u0391f\u03c6]\n  exact h h2\n\nhave h3 : \u0395W\u03b2 a b \u2260 Gn\u03910 := by\n  intro h4\n  exact h (h4)\n\nhave h5 : b = gf\u03a7 := by\n  apply \u211dR\u039e\u03a7JR\u2102Y\u03c8e\u2115\n  exact h3\n  exact ha\n\nexact h5"}
