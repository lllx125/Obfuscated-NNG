{"draft": "To prove the theorem \u211du\u0392wpl\u03c5tc\u0394\u03c3T\u0391\u03be, we start with the assumption that \u0395W\u03b2 a b = \u0395W\u03b2 a c. Our goal is to show that b = c under the condition that a \u2260 Gn\u03910. We will utilize the properties of the function \u0395W\u03b2 and the axioms provided. First, we can apply the axiom \u039d_ziv\u03bayA, which states that \u0395W\u03b2 (\u03987\u039ar a) b = \u039ax\u039d (\u0395W\u03b2 a b) b. Since a is not equal to Gn\u03910, we can conclude that a must be of the form \u03987\u039ar d for some d. Thus, we can rewrite our equation using this form. After substituting, we will have two expressions involving \u039ax\u039d, which we can manipulate using the properties of \u039ax\u039d to show that b must equal c. We will also need to use the axiom \u03b3d\u03baD\u03c7k\u03a9\u03a8\u03c1\u03b7_ea\u0394cU to conclude that if the two expressions are equal, then the inputs must be equal as well.
