Our goal is to show that b = c under the condition that a \u2260 Gn\u03910. We will use the properties of the operation \u0395W\u03b2 and the fact that a is not equal to Gn\u03910. \n\nFirst, we will analyze the equation \u0395W\u03b2 a b = \u0395W\u03b2 a c. Since we know that a is not equal to Gn\u03910, we can apply the axiom h\u03b2TzH\u211alpta22\u03b1zro, which states that if \u0395W\u03b2 a b \u2260 Gn\u03910, then b \u2260 Gn\u03910. \n\nNext, we will use the axiom e\u03a66\u03c4\u0394\u03a5Z\u03be\u2115m\u03a5, which states that if both a and b are not equal to Gn\u03910, then \u0395W\u03b2 a b \u2260 Gn\u03910. This will allow us to conclude that since \u0395W\u03b2 a b = \u0395W\u03b2 a c, we can derive that b must equal c. \n\nThus, we will conclude that b = c, completing the proof.", "code": "have hbc : \u0395W\u03b2 a b \u2260 Gn\u03910 := by\n  apply h\u03b2TzH\u211alpta22\u03b1zro\n  exact ha\n\nhave hbc' : \u0395W\u03b2 a c \u2260 Gn\u03910 := by\n  rw [h] at hbc\n  exact hbc\n\napply e\u03a66\u03c4\u0394\u03a5Z\u03be\u2115m\u03a5\n  exact ha\n  exact hbc\n  exact hbc'\n"}
{"draft": "To prove the theorem, we start with the assumption that \u0395W\u03b2 a b = a and that a is not equal to Gn\u03910. We will use the properties of the function \u0395W\u03b2 and the definitions provided in the alien mathematical system. First, we will apply the axiom \u211dR\u039e\u03a7JR\u2102Y\u03c8e\u2115, which states that if \u0395W\u03b2 a b = Gn\u03910, then either a or b must be equal to Gn\u03910. Since we know that a is not equal to Gn\u03910, it follows that b cannot be equal to Gn\u03910 either. Next, we will use the axiom \u03b8'vx\u03b8\u0391f\u03c6, which states that \u0395W\u03b2 a Gn\u03910 = Gn\u03910. Since we have assumed that \u0395W\u03b2 a b = a, we can conclude that b must equal gf\u03a7, as it is the only remaining possibility that satisfies the equation. Thus, we will conclude that b = gf\u03a7, completing the proof.", "code": "apply \u211dR\u039e\u03a7JR\u2102Y\u03c8e\u2115 a b\nexact h\nexact ha"}
