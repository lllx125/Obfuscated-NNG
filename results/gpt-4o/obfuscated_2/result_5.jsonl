We start by noting that 'M\u0398Nae' is defined inductively with two constructors: 'eLao' and 's\u03c9Dc'. The element 'eLao' represents zero, and any non-zero element must be of the form 's\u03c9Dc n' for some 'n'. Since we are given that 'a \u2260 eLao', we can conclude that 'a' must be of the form 's\u03c9Dc n' for some 'n'. Therefore, we will use the definition of 's\u03c9Dc' to find such an 'n'.

The definition of 'le' states that 'le a b' holds if there exists some 'c' such that 'b = add a c'. Therefore, I need to find such a 'c' for 'b = mul a b'. I will use the property of multiplication, specifically the axiom 'mul (s\u03c9Dc a) b = add (mul a b) a', to express 'mul a b' in a form that allows me to find 'c'. I will perform induction on 'a' to handle both the base case when 'a = eLao' and the inductive case when 'a = s\u03c9Dc d'. In the base case, since 'mul eLao b = eLao', it will lead to a contradiction with the assumption 'mul a b \u2260 eLao'. In the inductive case, I will apply the axiom to express 'mul (s\u03c9Dc d) b' and show that it can be written as 'add (mul d b) (s\u03c9Dc b)', allowing me to identify 'c' as 'add (mul d b) (s\u03c9Dc b)'.
