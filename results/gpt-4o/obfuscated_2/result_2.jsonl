In our case, we will set m to eLao and n to m. Thus, we need to show that pow eLao (s\u03c9Dc m) = mul (pow eLao m) eLao. Since pow eLao m = one (by the axiom p\u211aowNzro), we can substitute this into our equation. Therefore, we will have mul one eLao, which by the axiom ul_\u039ee\u03c1ro equals eLao.
