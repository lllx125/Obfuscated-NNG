{"draft": "To prove the theorem 'mul_right_eq_self', we start with the assumption that 'mul a b = a' and that 'a' is not zero. We will manipulate the equation using the properties of multiplication and the definitions provided. First, we will rewrite 'mul a b = a' using the axiom 'mul_succ', which states that 'mul a (succ b) = add (mul a b) a'. This will help us express 'b' in terms of 'a' and 'mul a b'. Next, we will show that if 'b' were not equal to one, we would reach a contradiction. We will use the fact that 'one' is defined as 'succ zero' and explore the implications of 'b' being either 'zero' or 'succ n' for some 'n'. Finally, we will conclude that the only possibility that satisfies the equation is when 'b = one'.", "code": "cases b with\n| zero =>\n  rw [mul_zero] at h\n  contradiction\n| succ n =>\n  rw [mul_succ] at h\n  rw [h] at h\n  have : mul a n = zero := by\n    rw [\u2190 h]\n    exact zero_mul a\n  have : n = zero := by\n    apply le_zero\n    use a\n    rw [h]\n    exact zero_mul a\n  rw [this] at h\n  rw [one_eq_succ_zero] at h\n  exact h"}
