{"draft": "To prove the theorem 'mul_left_cancel', we start with the assumption that 'a' is not zero and that 'mul a b = mul a c'. Our goal is to show that 'b = c'. We will use the properties of multiplication and the fact that 'a' is non-zero to derive a contradiction if 'b' and 'c' are not equal. We will first rewrite the equation 'mul a b = mul a c' using the axiom 'mul_succ' to express both sides in terms of 'b' and 'c'. Then, we will analyze the cases for 'b' and 'c' being zero or non-zero. If either 'b' or 'c' is zero, we can use the property of multiplication with zero to derive a contradiction with our assumption that 'a' is non-zero. If both are non-zero, we can apply the axiom 'mul_ne_zero' to conclude that 'b' must equal 'c'. Therefore, we will conclude that 'b = c'.", "code": "have hbc : mul a b = mul a c := h\nhave h1 : mul a b \u2260 zero := by\n  intro h2\n  apply ha\n  rw [h2] at hbc\n  exact mul_eq_zero a b hbc\nhave h2 : mul a c \u2260 zero := by\n  intro h3\n  apply ha\n  rw [h3] at hbc\n  exact mul_eq_zero a c hbc\napply mul_left_ne_zero a b c ha\nexact hbc"}
{"draft": "To prove the theorem 'mul_right_eq_self', we start with the hypothesis that 'mul a b = a' and that 'a' is not zero. Our goal is to show that 'b' must equal 'one'. We will use the properties of multiplication defined in the system. First, we will rewrite the equation 'mul a b = a' using the axiom 'mul_succ', which states that 'mul a (succ b) = add (mul a b) a'. We will analyze the case where 'b' is either 'zero' or 'one' or a successor of some natural number. If 'b' is 'zero', then 'mul a zero' would equal 'zero', contradicting our assumption that 'mul a b = a' since 'a' is not zero. Thus, 'b' cannot be zero. Next, we will consider the case where 'b = one', which is defined as 'succ zero'. We will show that if 'b' is not 'one', then it must be of the form 'succ c' for some 'c'. We will rewrite 'mul a (succ c)' and use our original equation to derive a contradiction. This will lead us to conclude that 'b' must indeed be 'one'.", "code": "cases b with\n| zero =>\n  have h1 : mul a zero = zero := mul_zero a\n  contradiction\n| succ c =>\n  rw [mul_succ a c] at h\n  rw [h] at h\n  rw [add_right_eq_self a (mul a c)] at h\n  exact zero_ne_succ a"}
