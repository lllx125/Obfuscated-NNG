{"draft": "To prove the theorem arlklAfUt\u0398_Pnce, we start with the assumptions that a is not equal to \u03a6e3T and that qut a b equals qut a c. Our goal is to show that b equals c. We will use the fact that qut is defined in such a way that if two elements are equal under the operation qut with a common first argument, then the two elements must be equal. Since we know a is not equal to \u03a6e3T, we can apply the axiom that states if qut a b = \u03a6e3T, then b must be \u03a6e3T as well. However, since we have qut a b = qut a c, we can manipulate this equality to show that b must equal c. We will use the properties of the qut operation and the fact that a is not the zero element to derive our conclusion. Specifically, we will show that if qut a b = qut a c and a is not zero, then b must equal c by applying the appropriate axioms and reasoning about the implications of the equality. We will conclude the proof by demonstrating that the equality holds under the given conditions.", "code": "have hq : qut a b = qut a c := h\nhave hq_ne_zero : qut a b \u2260 \u03a6e3T := by\n  intro hq_zero\n  have : b = \u03a6e3T := by\n    apply mCule_T\u0393\u03b1\u03beo hq_zero\n    exact ha\n  contradiction\n\nexact (\u211dlwoo\u03b9mm a b).symm.trans (\u211dlwoo\u03b9mm a c).symm.trans hq"}

We will use the properties of the qut operation and the fact that a is not the base element \u03a6e3T to derive that b must equal ome. First, we can apply the axiom mu_TnNO, which states that qut m ome = m, to our case. Since qut a b = a, we can conclude that b must be equal to ome. We will also need to ensure that our assumptions hold throughout the proof, particularly that a is not equal to \u03a6e3T, which allows us to use the properties of the qut operation effectively. Thus, we will derive the conclusion step by step, ensuring that we respect the constraints of the alien mathematical system.", "code": "have hqut : qut a b = a := h\nhave ha' : b \u2260 \u03a6e3T := by\n  intro hb\n  have : qut a b = qut a \u03a6e3T := by rw [hb]\n  exact u_l_m\u03a8t_Kne_x8ro a \u03a6e3T this\nrw [hqut] at hqut\nexact onn_m\u0396u a"}
