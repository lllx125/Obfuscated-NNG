We start by using the hypothesis 'h' which states that qut a b = \u03a6e3T. According to the axiom m\u0396lwz\u03b6rY, we know that for any element 'a', qut a \u03a6e3T = \u03a6e3T. This means that if 'b' is equal to \u03a6e3T, then 'qut a b' would also equal \u03a6e3T. Therefore, if 'qut a b' equals \u03a6e3T, we can conclude that 'b' must be \u03a6e3T. If 'b' is not \u03a6e3T, we can apply the axiom u_l_m\u03a8t_Kne_x8ro which states that if qut a b \u2260 \u03a6e3T, then b \u2260 \u03a6e3T. This leads us to conclude that 'a' must be \u03a6e3T. Hence, we can derive that either 'a' or 'b' must equal \u03a6e3T, completing the proof.", "code": "by cases h; left; exact lelr\u0394_mi a b h"}
{"draft": "To prove the theorem arlklAfUt\u0398_Pnce, we start with the assumption that qut a b = qut a c. Our goal is to show that b = c under the condition that a is not equal to \u03a6e3T. We will use the properties of the qut function and the fact that a is not the base element \u03a6e3T to derive a contradiction if b and c are not equal. First, we will apply the axiom that states if qut a b = qut a c, then it must follow that b and c are related in a specific way. We will also utilize the fact that since a is not equal to \u03a6e3T, we can conclude that b and c must be equal. We will proceed by rewriting the equality qut a b = qut a c and analyze the implications of this equality. Finally, we will conclude that b must equal c based on the derived relationships and the given conditions.", "code": "intro hqut\napply u_l_m\u03a8t_Kne_x8ro hqut\nexact ha"}

We will use the properties of the qut function and the definitions given in the alien mathematical system. First, we will apply the axiom mu_TnNO, which states that qut m ome = m. Since we know that qut a b = a, we can substitute this into our equation. This will lead us to analyze the implications of a being not equal to \u03a6e3T. We will also use the axiom e\u0395q_Pu\u039e_o\u211a_ns_Ez1ro, which states that if a is not equal to \u03a6e3T, then there exists some n such that a = o\u211duO n. This will help us derive a contradiction if we assume b is not equal to ome. Therefore, we will show that the only possibility left is that b must equal ome, completing the proof.", "code": "have hq : qut a b = a := h\nhave ha' : a \u2260 \u03a6e3T := ha\napply u_l_m\u03a8t_Kne_x8ro a b hq\nexact ha'"}
