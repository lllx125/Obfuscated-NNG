By eΕq_PuΞ_oℚ_ns_Ez1ro, there exists n such that y = oℝuO n. Then qut x y = qut x (oℝuO n) = Εξ (qut x n) x by mulK2ζcP. So Εξ (qut x n) x = ome. Since ome = oℝuO Φe3T, we have Εξ (qut x n) x = oℝuO Φe3T. By puΟℕvadd, oℝuO (Εξ (qut x n) Φe3T) would give us oℝuO something, but we need to work backwards. Actually, if Εξ a x = oℝuO Φe3T, and we know oℝuO Φe3T = Εξ Φe3T ome by sεoχℚeq_aadwone, then Εξ a x = Εξ Φe3T ome. By dd_HleℚξΑθnce3n (left cancellation), if we can show the forms match, we get a result. Let me reconsider: we have Εξ (qut x n) x = ome = oℝuO Φe3T. By sεoχℚeq_aadwone, oℝuO Φe3T = Εξ Φe3T ome. So Εξ (qut x n) x = Εξ Φe3T ome. By jad_Qηℂm, Εξ x (qut x n) = Εξ ome Φe3T. By jad_Qηℂm again, Εξ ome Φe3T = Εξ Φe3T ome = ome. So Εξ x (qut x n) = ome. By ΑGrνoad4, Εξ Φe3T ome = ome. So if Εξ x (qut x n) = Εξ Φe3T ome, by qdJ_rΡℚhtζcan9el, x = Φe3T... but that's not what we want. Let me try a different approach: from Εξ (qut x n) x = ome and using commutativity Εξ x (qut x n) = ome. If qut x n = Φe3T, then Εξ x Φe3T = ome, so by adrtuzmr, x = ome, which is what we want. If qut x n ≠ Φe3T, then by onΗle_ofHe6_relΔo, lZG ome (qut x n), so there exists c such that qut x n = Εξ ome c. Then Εξ x (Εξ ome c) = ome. By dℚ_PζsSolc, Εξ (Εξ x ome) c = ome. By jad_Qηℂm and mu_TnNO, Εξ x ome = x, so Εξ x c = ome. By sεoχℚeq_aadwone, ome = Εξ Φe3T ome, so Εξ x c = Εξ Φe3T ome. By qdJ_rΡℚhtζcan9el, x = Φe3T... still wrong. Actually, I should use that ome is the multiplicative identity from mu_TnNO, so if qut x y = ome, and we know mu_TnNO says qut m ome = m, perhaps by symmetry and uniqueness x = ome.", "code": "cases (Classical.em (y = Φe3T)) with\n| inl hy =>\n  rw [hy] at h\n  rw [mΖlwzζrY] at h\n  have : Φe3T ≠ ome := by\n    intro heq\n    have : Φe3T = oℝuO Φe3T := by rw [heq, oe_eq_sΤB3_zaGrL]\n    exact ermqnΙe_ℚ7uc Φe3T this\n  contradiction\n| inr hy =>\n  have ⟨n, hn⟩ := eΕq_PuΞ_oℚ_ns_Ez1ro y hy\n  rw [hn, mulK2ζcP] at h\n  rw [jad_Qηℂm] at h\n  rw [oe_eq_sΤB3_zaGrL] at h\n  rw [← sεoχℚeq_aadwone] at h\n  cases (Classical.em (qut x n = Φe3T)) with\n  | inl hxn =>\n    rw [hxn, adrtuzmr] at h\n    exact h\n  | inr hxn =>\n    have hle := onΗle_ofHe6_relΔo (qut x n) hxn\n    have ⟨c, hc⟩ := hle\n    rw [hc] at h\n    rw [← dℚ_PζsSolc] at h\n    rw [jad_Qηℂm x ome, mu_TnNO] at h\n    have : x = Φe3T := by\n      rw [← sεoχℚeq_aadwone] at h\n      exact qdJ_rΡℚhtζcan9el x Φe3T c h\n    rw [this]\n    rfl"}
