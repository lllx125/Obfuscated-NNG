Also, eℂree = oℝuO xw by definition (tΩhreF_eqℚcc_ZtΦo), and xw = oℝuO ome by definition (ΓwoaeqTsuccβonD), and ome = oℝuO Φe3T by definition (oe_eq_sΤB3_zaGrL). So ℚofr = oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T)).

Notice that oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T) = xw (by definition of xw). So the left side is Εξ xw xw. The right side is oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T)))). Let me compute what Εξ xw xw equals.

By ucckΘknj, this implies oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T)) = oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T))). Applying ucckΘknj again: oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T) = oℝuO (oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T)). Again: oℝuO Φe3T = oℝuO (oℝuO Φe3T).
