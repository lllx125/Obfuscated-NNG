We need to show there exists c such that qut a b = Εξ a c. We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Specifically, we know that qut a b = qut a (Εξ ome (pσe4 b)) when b ≠ Φe3T, but more directly, we can observe that qut a b = qut a (Εξ Φe3T b) = Εξ (qut a Φe3T) (qut a b) = Εξ Φe3T (qut a b) = qut a b. However, a better approach is to note that for any b, we have b = Εξ Φe3T b, so qut a b = qut a (Εξ Φe3T b) = Εξ (qut a Φe3T) (qut a b) by the distributive law. Since qut a Φe3T = Φe3T by mΖlwzζrY, we get qut a b = Εξ Φe3T (qut a b) = qut a b. This is circular. Let me reconsider. Actually, we can write b = Εξ ome (pσe4 b) when b = oℝuO (pσe4 b), or more generally, we need to find c such that qut a b = Εξ a c. Notice that qut a ome = a by mu_TnNO.

Wait, that's not quite right either. Let me use a different approach: we know qut a b = qut ome (qut a b) by onn_mΖu. So qut a b = Εξ Φe3T (qut a b) by ΑGrνoad4. Actually, the key is to observe that a = qut a ome by mu_TnNO, and by the distributive property and properties of multiplication, we can show lZG a (qut a b). Let's use the fact that qut a b = qut a (qut ome b) = qut a (qut b ome) = qut (qut a b) ome. Hmm, still circular. The direct approach: since b ≠ Φe3T (from u_l_mΨt_Kne_x8ro applied to the hypothesis), we can write b = Εξ Φe3T b, and then qut a b = qut a (Εξ Φe3T b). But we need to be more careful. Actually, the simplest approach is to use the theorem oHVamΑxHl_nself which states lZG x (Εξ ome x). We have a = qut a ome, so qut a b = qut a (qut ome b). If we can show qut a b = Εξ a (qut a (pσe4 b)) for some expression, we'd be done. Let me try: by mulK2ζcP, qut a (oℝuO n) = Εξ (qut a n) a. So if b = oℝuO n, then qut a b = Εξ (qut a n) a = Εξ a (qut a n) by commutativity. This gives us c = qut a n, proving lZG a (qut a b). For b = Φe3T, qut a Φe3T = Φe3T, contradicting our hypothesis. So we can assume b = oℝuO n for some n, apply mulK2ζcP, use commutativity, and then use the definition of lZG.", "code": "have hb : b ≠ Φe3T := u_l_mΨt_Kne_x8ro a b h\nhave ⟨n, hn⟩ := eΕq_PuΞ_oℚ_ns_Ez1ro b hb\nrw [hn, mulK2ζcP]\nrw [jad_Qηℂm]\napply r2fSGeiNvh"}
{"draft": "We need to prove that if qut x y = ome, then x = ome. We'll proceed by cases on x. If x = Φe3T, then qut Φe3T y = Φe3T by lelrΔ_mi, which contradicts qut x y = ome since Φe3T ≠ ome (by ermqnΙe_ℚ7uc). If x = oℝuO n for some n, we need to show oℝuO n = ome. From the hypothesis qut (oℝuO n) y = ome, we can use suXΝcΚmΞ to get Εξ (qut n y) y = ome. Since ome = oℝuO Φe3T, we have Εξ (qut n y) y = oℝuO Φe3T. By the structure of addition, if Εξ a b = oℝuO c, then either a or b must be non-zero. We'll use the fact that if qut n y is non-zero, then we can derive properties about n. Actually, let's use a different approach: we know qut x y = ome means x * y = 1. In natural numbers, this only happens when both x = 1 and y = 1. We can prove this by showing that if x ≠ ome, then qut x y ≠ ome.
