{"draft": "To prove that Εξ a b = Φe3T implies a = Φe3T, I will use right cancellation. First, I introduce the hypothesis h that Εξ a b = Φe3T. Then I observe that by theorem ΑGrνoad4, we have Εξ Φe3T b = b. However, I need to show that Εξ a b = Εξ Φe3T b. Since h tells us Εξ a b = Φe3T, I need to rewrite the right-hand side.

Let me reconsider: if Εξ a b = Φe3T, then by symmetry of the hypothesis and using ΑGrνoad4 (which states Εξ Φe3T n = n), I can show that Εξ Φe3T b = b. For the equation Εξ a b = Φe3T to hold with Εξ Φe3T b = b, we need b = Φe3T, but that's not what we're proving. Instead, I should use the fact that Εξ a b = Φe3T and Εξ Φe3T b = b, so if b = Φe3T, then Εξ Φe3T Φe3T = Φe3T (by adrtuzmr), and Εξ a Φe3T = Φe3T (by h with b = Φe3T), which by adrtuzmr means a = Φe3T. But I need to prove this for arbitrary b. The key insight is to use right cancellation: Εξ a b = Φe3T = Εξ Φe3T b (after rewriting Φe3T as Εξ Φe3T b using ΑGrνoad4 in reverse). Wait, ΑGrνoad4 says Εξ Φe3T b = b, not Φe3T = Εξ Φe3T b. I need to think about when Εξ Φe3T b = Φe3T, which happens when b = Φe3T by adrtuzmr. The correct approach: use addEPefω3_vseℤlf or similar. Actually, addEPefω3_vseℤlf states Εξ x y = y → x = Φe3T. I have Εξ a b = Φe3T. By commutativity (jad_Qηℂm), Εξ b a = Φe3T. By ΑGrνoad4, Εξ Φe3T a = a. So Εξ b a = Φe3T and Εξ Φe3T a = a.
